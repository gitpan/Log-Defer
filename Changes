  * Removed Log::Defer::Viz since it's getting its own
    CPAN distribution so you don't need to install its
    dependencies on your servers
  * Added verbosity option
  * Now you can pass a hashref into the constructor
    in order to support extra args (like verbosity).
    The old way is still supported too.
